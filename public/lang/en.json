It is responsible for regulating the securities market, including stock trading, issuance, exchanges, brokers, trading operations by individuals, and investment companies. The SEC also oversees mergers and acquisitions of companies. This means that if an asset is traded on U.S. exchanges or is accessible to an American broker, it is automatically subject to the rules established by the SEC. The main goal of this organization is to ensure transparency in transactions and to combat fraudulent activities."
